# Brazilian news

This is a web scraping project that builds a dataset of the most recent news on the main news sites in Brazil. I choose [g1](https://g1.globo.com/), [uol](https://www.uol.com.br/) and [CNN Brasil](https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/). 

It uses python with the librares selenium and BeaultifulSoup.
